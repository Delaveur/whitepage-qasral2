      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">Serving Arabic coffee is a cherished tradition that reflects respect and generosity. The ritual of offering guests a small, elegant cup of coffee—often accompanied by dates—is not merely about refreshment, but about cultural connection and warmth.</p>
      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">The server holds the dallah (coffee pot) with the left hand and pours with the right, a practice steeped in symbolism and grace. This gesture is both welcoming and ceremonial, reflecting a deep-rooted heritage of hospitality.</p>
      <blockquote class="text-xl italic text-[#5c4332]">"In every cup, a welcome. In every gesture, respect."</blockquote>

      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">The majlis, a traditional gathering space, is central to social life in the UAE. Here, people come together to discuss ideas, share stories, and foster relationships. The layout, typically with cushions around the room, reflects openness and equality among guests.</p>
      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">This age-old tradition continues today, connecting generations and embodying the essence of community and shared values. It is where hospitality meets dialogue, and where everyone has a place.</p>
      <blockquote class="text-xl italic text-[#5c4332]">"The majlis is more than a room; it's the heart of Emirati welcome."</blockquote>

      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">Hospitality in Emirati culture is a deeply held value passed down through generations. Guests are honored with warmth and sincerity, reflecting a legacy rooted in Bedouin customs, where sharing and sheltering were vital in desert life.</p>
      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">Today, that same spirit lives on in every greeting and every open door. Whether for visitors from afar or neighbors next door, hospitality remains a cornerstone of national identity.</p>
      <blockquote class="text-xl italic text-[#5c4332]">"To welcome is to honor. To share is to belong."</blockquote>
