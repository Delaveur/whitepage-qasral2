      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">The Palace of Light stands as a breathtaking testament to architectural brilliance, where ancient motifs meet modern design philosophies. Each structure within the complex is not merely functional but designed to inspire, reflect, and preserve. Traditional geometric patterns, hand-carved details, and symbolic layouts draw from centuries of regional design, paying homage to a deep cultural legacy.</p>
      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">At the same time, the palace incorporates state-of-the-art engineering and sustainable technologies, making it a landmark not just of beauty but of forward-thinking construction. Vaulted ceilings, light-diffusing domes, and precision-matched marble work all serve both aesthetic and environmental purposes—ensuring the legacy of the past meets the needs of the present and future.</p>

      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">From floor mosaics to ceiling domes, every element of the palace interior has been crafted with exceptional care. Artisans and designers worked together to produce visual harmony, with floral arabesques, calligraphic inscriptions, and gilded elements echoing through every hall and corridor. These intricate details do more than decorate—they narrate the story of a nation’s spirit and artistic soul.</p>
      <p class="text-[#2d2d2d] mb-4">Light plays a central role in the palace’s interior design. Natural light filters through custom latticework and stained glass, casting colored patterns across polished stone. Every transition from room to room is a journey—each space uniquely composed to evoke awe, reverence, and serenity, culminating in an experience that stimulates both the eye and the soul.</p>
